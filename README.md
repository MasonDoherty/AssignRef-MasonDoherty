# AssignRef-MasonDoherty

AssignRef is a comprehensive platform designed exclusively for game officials of the Liga de FÃºtbol Americano Profesional (LFA). It facilitates the process of game assignment, performance evaluation, knowledge assessment, and fair compensation for their invaluable contributions.

AssignRef is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This Repository contains SQL .NET and React code for the Venue's feature.
